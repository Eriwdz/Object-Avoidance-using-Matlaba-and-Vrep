# Object Avoidance using Matlaba and Vrep
I have simulated a differential drive robot in VREP using commands from Matlab. The model being used here is that of Pioneer_p3dx. It is an object avoidance robot equipped with ultrasonic sensors. The environment is created in vrep. It consists of cuboids and cylinders of various sized and a bounded wall so that the robot does not fall off.

The programmed behaviour added here is that of object avoidance. Three sensors have been used to estimate the distance of obstacle from the robot. The sensors selected are at the front, left and right side of the robot. The sensors at the back are not used yet. (it is assumed here, that the robot will only move in forward direction).
